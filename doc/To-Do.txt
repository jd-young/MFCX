* Use namespace MFCX.
* Start all classes with CX....
* Create a doxygen project for it.
* Replace TList etc templates with the STL ones.



* Open BCGControlBarStatic.dsp workspace and build the static library. 
* In the Visual C++® open "Resource Includes" dialog (View | Resource Includes) 
* Add #include "bcgbarres.h" to "Read-only symbol directives". 
* Add #include "bcgcontrolbar.rc" to "compile-time directives".
  (if your project requires localization, type 
  
  	#include "L.***\bcgcontrolbar.rc" 

  where *** is a language name prefix. See Localization page for more details) 

* Remove _AFX_NO_SPLITTER_RESOURCES. Otherwise, you'll not be able to see 
  splitter cursors required by the library.

  "#define _BCGCONTROLBAR_STATIC_" to "compile-time directives".
